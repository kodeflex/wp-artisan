A command-line toolkit for work on custom [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) developments in an efficient way.

> I'd love to hear from anyone who wish to contribute. Feel free to submit issues, feature requests and any suggestions you mind. PRs are welcome! :-)

> This project forked form [WordPress CLI](https://github.com/thinkholic/wordpress-cli/).

> The project is depricated as we couldn't actively involve in further development. Please use [`WP_CLI`](https://wp-cli.org/) instead. It's fully fledge alternative for what we were planning to do even it's not the same thing.
